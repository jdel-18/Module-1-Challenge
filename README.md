# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

In this project, the goal was to change all the <div> elements to semantic elements. Using semantic elements is important because it gives the code structure, making it easier to work on later. Additionally, semantic elements can help with search engine optimization by giving better context to the page. Through this project, I learned how to use semantic elements to create better, and easier to understand code, and why they are so important for us the coder and for accessibility users who rely on screen reading device.
